## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Useful resources

- [Change from black to any color by filter in css](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This helped me change the color of svg, because for some reason fill, and current color did not work and so I had to explicitly declare white in svg file, which again I was unable to change in css, so had to rely on this to change color of logo svg on hover.
